WordPress plugin for integrating with Semantria to generate custom taxonomies.

Author's word, "I always strive to make the best than I can but live resolutely in the knowledge than I have much more to learn from you than you from I." 

== Description ==

Simple plugin that allows you to connect to your [Semantria](http://semantria.com/) API account to WordPress to generate tags and custom taxonomies for your Posts.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the files to the '/wp-content/plugins/wp-semantria/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -> Semantria Settings and enter your Semantria Consumer Key and Secret and Save.
4. Click "Perform Data Ingestion" and then make a cup of tea :-)
